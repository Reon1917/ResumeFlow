# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the ResumeFlow authentication system by implementing Google SSO authentication alongside the existing email/password authentication, and fixes the Gemini API integration to use the correct SDK and configuration. The enhancement will provide users with a seamless, professional login experience while ensuring proper AI integration for resume analysis and interview preparation features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign in with my Google account, so that I can quickly access the platform without creating a separate password.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the login page THEN the system SHALL display a "Sign in with Google" button alongside existing email/password options
2. WHEN a user clicks the "Sign in with Google" button THEN the system SHALL redirect to Google's OAuth consent screen
3. WHEN a user successfully authenticates with Google THEN the system SHALL create or update their user profile in Firestore
4. WHEN a user signs in with Google THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the dashboard page
5. IF a user cancels the Google authentication THEN the system SHALL return them to the login page with no error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want a professional and aesthetic login interface, so that I feel confident about the platform's quality and security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the login page THEN the system SHALL display a modern, clean design with proper spacing and typography
2. WHEN a user interacts with form elements THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback with smooth transitions and hover effects
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display the ResumeFlow branding consistently with the overall application design
4. WHEN a user views the page on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a responsive layout that works on all screen sizes
5. WHEN authentication is in progress THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states with visual indicators

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Gemini API integration to use the correct SDK and configuration, so that AI features work reliably and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes the Gemini client THEN the system SHALL use the @google/generative-ai package with correct imports
2. WHEN configuring the Gemini model THEN the system SHALL use gemini-2.5-flash model with thinkingBudget set to 0
3. WHEN making API calls to Gemini THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages
4. WHEN the Gemini API is called THEN the system SHALL ensure API keys are only used server-side through Next.js API routes
5. IF the Gemini API fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and provide fallback responses to users

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication state to persist across browser sessions, so that I don't have to sign in repeatedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL maintain their session until they explicitly log out
2. WHEN a user closes and reopens their browser THEN the system SHALL automatically restore their authenticated state
3. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page with a clear message
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all authentication tokens and redirect to the login page
5. WHEN a user accesses protected routes without authentication THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling and security measures in place, so that the application is secure and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages without exposing sensitive information
2. WHEN API keys are configured THEN the system SHALL ensure they are stored securely in environment variables
3. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all input data
4. WHEN Firebase operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide appropriate user feedback
5. WHEN rate limiting is exceeded THEN the system SHALL inform users and suggest retry timing
